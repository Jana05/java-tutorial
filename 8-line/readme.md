#Line
- In this project we need two point for draw a line .
- And using setter and  getter for that two points.
- Print the value using tostring.
- We are mainly findout distance of a line.
- So we can calculate distance of line using distance calculation formula.
- In this project we are create calDistance() method for finds line of distance formula
  * sqrt((x2-x1)^2(y2-y1)^2).
- Use to sqrt values in java we are using **Math.sqrt() method**
##Lint test
- In this LineTest class calls **Line class** 
- Create a object using constructor to store the value.
- And print object value print statement.
